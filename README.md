## Overview

AITAKATA is a mobile smart virtual assistant for the early prevention and advanced potential of breast cancer based on AI and gamification. One of our focuses is on the issue where individuals at potential risk of breast cancer feel EMBARRASSED to find out, EMBARASSED then believe that their current condition is not a symptom of breast cancer, as well as being EMBARRASSED to undergo check-ups.

AITAKATA utilizes Generative AI technology to provide a virtual assistant, chatbot, and integrated nutritional recommendations, as well as machine learning to detect early breast cancer risks without the need to feel EMBARRASSED. There are features such as self-examinations, healthy lifestyle recommendations packaged in engaging features. Additionally, the application can be something continuously used by users, with gamification integrated into the app. And, of course, these features always prioritize the privacy of users.
